# Wheel of Misfortune
A Javascript Halloween/Spooky themed web application based on the famous Wheel of Fortune game.


## Description
This is a personal project web application I made for Halloween in 2022 when hosting a party. I wanted a game which played like wheel of fortune but was very spooky and dark. As there was nothing I could find anywhere, I made it myself using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Features all sorts of spooky sound effects, ambient backgrounds, and taunts! Most were recorded by me a sampled down but a few you might recognize from Mortal Combat, "Flawless Victory!" :)

The clues are loaded via JSON and can be fully customized for whatever categories you like. I have about 30 included here as a default install but welcome more contributions!

For my setup I just used my mac and airplayed to the TV so everyone could see and play. But could also be done with a smart TV browser and local web server too. Just need to have a browser, keyboard, and mouse.

There are not many options yet on the spinning wheel but this can easily be expanded to include more prizes and penalties, it worked for my needs.

## Local Setup

1) Clone the git repo

2) Open the index.html file in your browser and hit Play. This will open up a new tab with the game, the previous tab will play the spooky ambient music while the game is being played.

3) Play the game!
